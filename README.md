# Data Science in Python - Assignment 2

This repo is my submission for the second assignment for the master module Data Science in Python at the University College Dublin.

The assignment was to analyse a dataset consisting of structured and unstructured data by training machine learning models and visualizing the data.
The full assignment can be found [here](COMP41680%20-%20Assignment%202-3.pdf).

The assignment is divided into four parts:

1. [Data cleaning and preparation](cleanup_task_1.ipynb)
2. [Simple analysis and visualization](analyse_task_2.ipynb)
3. [Machine learning models structured data](Classification_task_3.ipynb)
4. [Machine learning models on text data](Natural_Language_task_4.ipynb)

## Dataset

The dataset for this assignment was made up of survey responses of bank customers and comments on the bank's services.
